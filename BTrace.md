## BTrace (Java edition DTrace) ##

BTrace is a safe, dynamic tracing tool for the Java platform. BTrace can be used to dynamically trace a running Java program (similar to DTrace for OpenSolaris applications and OS). BTrace dynamically instruments the classes of the target application to inject tracing code ("bytecode tracing"). Tracing code is expressed in Java programming language. There is also integration with DTrace for the OpenSolaris platform.
