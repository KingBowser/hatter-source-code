AESCrypt Java
-------------

This package contains the Java class es.vocali.util.AESCrypt
which provides file encryption and decryption using
the aescrypt file format specified at:

   http://www.aescrypt.com/aes_file_format.html

Versions 1 & 2 are supported both for reading and writing.
Version 0 is not supported.

Requirements
------------

It only works in Java 6, but can be easily adapted to Java 5
by replacing the call to NetworkInterface.getHardwareAddress()
with something else.

In order to use 256 bit AES keys, you must download and install
"Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction
Policy Files" from:

   http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
