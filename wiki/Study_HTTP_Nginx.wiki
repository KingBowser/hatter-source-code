Nginx的`proxy_pass`不识别`/etc/hosts`

替代方案：
You can get around this by installing dnsmasq and setting your resolver to 127.0.0.1. Basically this uses your local DNS as a resolver, but it only resolves what it knows about (among those things is your /etc/hosts) and forwards the rest to your default DNS.
