ZooKeeper中的时间<br>
ZooKeeper中通过多种方式来表达时间：<br>
*Zxid*
Every change to the ZooKeeper state receives a stamp in the form of a zxid (ZooKeeper Transaction Id). This exposes the total ordering of all changes to ZooKeeper. Each change will have a unique zxid and if zxid1 is smaller than zxid2 then zxid1 happened before zxid2.
 *Version numbers*
 Every change to a a node will cause an increase to one of the version numbers of that node. The three version numbers are version (number of changes to the data of a znode), cversion (number of changes to the children of a znode), and aversion (number of changes to the ACL of a znode).
 * Ticks
 When using multi-server ZooKeeper, servers use ticks to define timing of events such as status uploads, session timeouts, connection timeouts between peers, etc. The tick time is only indirectly exposed through the minimum session timeout (2 times the tick time); if a client requests a session timeout less than the minimum session timeout, the server will tell the client that the session timeout is actually the minimum session timeout.
 * Real time
 ZooKeeper doesn't use real time, or clock time, at all except to put timestamps into the stat structure on znode creation and znode modification.

ZooKeeper Stat Structure
The Stat structure for each znode in ZooKeeper is made up of the following fields:

 * czxid
 The zxid of the change that caused this znode to be created.
 * mzxid
 The zxid of the change that last modified this znode.
 * ctime
 The time in milliseconds from epoch when this znode was created.
 * mtime
 The time in milliseconds from epoch when this znode was last modified.
 * version
 The number of changes to the data of this znode.
 * cversion
 The number of changes to the children of this znode.
 * aversion
 The number of changes to the ACL of this znode.
 * ephemeralOwner
 The session id of the owner of this znode if the znode is an ephemeral node. If it is not an ephemeral node, it will be zero.
 * dataLength
 The length of the data field of this znode.
 * numChildren
 The number of children of this znode.
