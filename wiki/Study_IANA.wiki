==The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for the global coordination of the DNS Root, IP addressing, and other Internet protocol resources.==

 * Domain Names
 IANA manages the DNS Root Zone (assignments of ccTLDs and gTLDs) along with other functions such as the .int and .arpa zones.
 * Number Resources
 IANA coordinates allocations from the global IP and AS number spaces, such as those made to Regional Internet Registries.
 * Protocol Assignments
 IANA is the central repository for protocol name and number registries used in many Internet protocols.
